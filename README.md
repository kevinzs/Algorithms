# algorithms
This repository contais Python and Pyglet (graphic librari) implementation for some algorithms and interesting
stuff to practice with Python. The implementation of the algorithms may not be the best.

Implementation of the cellular automaton created by the British mathematician John Horton Conway.
More info about the automaton: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

Instructions:
  - Mouse click: Set (x,y) cell alive.
  - Space: pause the automaton (Recommended to draw the pattern).

Implementation of the searching algorithm in a grid version.
More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search

Instructions:
  - Right mouse click: Set the start position.
  - Middle mouse click: Set the end position.
  - Left mouse click: Draw a wall. 
  - Space: start BFS.
  - Key D: Clear the grid.
